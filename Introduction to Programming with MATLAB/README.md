## Week 1: Introduction to the course
In this week, you will get an overview of the course and understand the objectives and expectations. You will be introduced to MATLAB as a programming language and its various features.

## Week 2: Different versions of MATLAB
During this week, you will explore different versions of MATLAB and learn about their features and capabilities. You will also understand how to set up and install MATLAB on your computer.

## Week 3: Matrices and operators
Week 3 focuses on matrices and operators in MATLAB. You will learn how to create and manipulate matrices, perform various operations on them, and understand the concept of array indexing.

## Week 4: Functions
In Week 4, you will dive into functions in MATLAB. You will learn how to create user-defined functions, understand the scope and lifetime of variables, and explore function input and output arguments.

## Week 5: Programmer's Toolbox
This week is dedicated to the Programmer's Toolbox in MATLAB. You will explore different tools and techniques that can enhance your programming experience, such as debugging, profiling, and optimizing your code.

## Week 6: Selection
Week 6 focuses on selection structures in MATLAB. You will learn how to use conditional statements (if-else and switch-case) to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.

## Week 7: Loops
During this week, you will delve into loops in MATLAB. You will understand how to use iterative structures (for and while loops) to perform repetitive tasks and iterate over arrays.

## Week 8: Data types
Week 8 covers various data types in MATLAB. You will explore fundamental data types such as numeric, logical, and character arrays, as well as more advanced data structures like cell arrays and structures.

## Week 9: File input/output
In the final week, you will learn how to read from and write to files in MATLAB. You will understand different file formats, such as text and binary, and explore various file input/output operations.
