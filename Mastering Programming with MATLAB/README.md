# Introduction to Programming with MATLAB

This repository contains the course materials for **Introduction to Programming with MATLAB**. The course is designed to provide an introductory understanding of programming using MATLAB, covering various topics over a span of nine weeks.

## Table of Contents
* Week 1: Introduction to the course
* Week 2: Functions Revisited (covering some more advanced concepts such as recursion, function handles and nested functions among others.)

## Week 1: Introduction to the course
In this week, you will get an overview of the course and understand the objectives and expectations. You will be introduced to MATLAB as a programming language and its various features.

## Week 2: Functions Revisited
Functions may very well be the most important abstraction in computer programming. We learned a lot about them in the first course, but here we'll cover some more advanced concepts such as recursion, function handles and nested functions among others.

Feel free to explore the materials for each week by navigating through the corresponding sections in this repository.
