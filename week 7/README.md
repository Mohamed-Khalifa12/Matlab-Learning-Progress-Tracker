# sumintup
This function utilizes a looping concept to calculate the summation of numbers starting from zero up to a given positive integer input 'n'.

# randCheck
This pertains to the idea that in MATLAB, the counter can be a floating-point number instead of just an integer, which is determined by the value that is specified in the array.
The primary objective of this function is to determine whether the randomly generated number is greater than or less than 0.5.

# fibo
This function is an implementation of a for loop. It generates a Fibonacci series in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The function returns an array of numbers that equals the number of positive integers that were passed as an input.
